My collection of Mathematica notebooks I want to share.

# Teaching Schemes to Grad Students
A collection of information regarding differential schemes.
## Content
- Stylesheet ([original creator](https://www.mtu.edu/math/department/faculty-staff/faculty/gregersen/))
- FE, BE, CE, and " $\alpha$-Skewed " Methods for the ODE $u_{x}\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)$ on $\left[a,b\right]$ given $u\left(a\right)=u_{0}$ for uniform meshes.
  - Derivation
  - Pseudocode
  - Code
- RBF Method for the ODE $u_{x}\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)$ on $\left[a,b\right]$ given $u\left(a\right)=u_{0}$ for uniform meshes.
  - Derivation
  - Pseudocode
  - Code
## Future Plans
- More worked ODEs
- Worked PDEs
- Finite Element Method
- Non-uniform meshes
- Optimizations
- Introductory "lessons"
  - Quick start to DEs & integration
  - Quick start to Linear Algebra
  - Consistency & stability analyses
- Anything I get requested

# polynomialSolver
All the content in this notebook is an extension and optimization of the FEM method. This will eventually be fully incorporated into the notebook **Teaching Schemes to Grad Students.nb**.

# polyFractal
This notebook generates fractals based on the theory of [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game). Able to generate a fractal within perfect polygons with customization including:
- Base polygon color
- Fractal's color
- Fractal points' size
- Image quality (memory intensive)

# Interpolating Polynomials
Provides code for how one can interpolate a function with polynomials as well as exporting a .gif as you increase the number of sample points.
